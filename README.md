# Value Area Expert Advisor (MT5)

This is an experimental Expert Advisor (EA) developed for MetaTrader 5, built around the concept of the **Value Area** and **Point of Control (POC)** from volume profile analysis.

The strategy is based on the classic 80% Value Area rule:
> If price opens outside the previous session‚Äôs Value Area and re-enters it, there is a high probability (~80%) that it will traverse the entire area.

This project is intended to **explore**:
- How to calculate the Value Area (VAL, VAH, and POC) programmatically
- Entry logic when price returns to the Value Area
- Potential use of **Swing High/Low** levels for trend identification
- How to integrate technical context into automated trading
